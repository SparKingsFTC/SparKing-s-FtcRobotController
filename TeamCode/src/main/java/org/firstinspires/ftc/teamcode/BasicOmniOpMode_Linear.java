/*
 * This file contains an example of a Linear "OpMode".
 * An OpMode is a 'program' that runs in either the autonomous or the teleop period of an FTC match.
 * The names of OpModes appear on the menu of the FTC Driver Station.
 * When a selection is made from the menu, the corresponding OpMode is executed.
 *
 * This particular OpMode illustrates driving a 4-motor Omni-Directional (or Holonomic) robot.
 * This code will work with either a Mecanum-Drive or an X-Drive train.
 * Both of these drives are illustrated at https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/robot-design/drivetrains/holonomic.html
 * Note that a Mecanum drive must display an X roller-pattern when viewed from above.
 *
 * Also note that it is critical to set the correct rotation direction for each motor.  See details below.
 *
 * Holonomic drives provide the ability for the robot to move in three axes (directions) simultaneously.
 * Each motion axis is controlled by one Joystick axis.
 *
 * 1) Axial:    Driving forward and backward               Left-joystick Forward/Backward
 * 2) Lateral:  Strafing right and left                     Left-joystick Right and Left
 * 3) Yaw:      Rotating Clockwise and counter clockwise    Right-joystick Right and Left
 *
 * This code is written assuming that the right-side motors need to be reversed for the robot to drive forward.
 * When you first test your robot, if it moves backward when you push the left stick forward, then you must flip
 * the direction of all 4 motors (see code below).
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list

  To find this, we first need to consider the total gear reduction powering our arm.
  First, we have an external 20t:100t (5:1) reduction created by two spur gears.
  But we also have an internal gear reduction in our motor.
  The motor we use for this arm is a 117RPM Yellow Jacket. Which has an internal gear
  reduction of ~50.9:1. (more precisely it is 250047/4913:1)
  We can multiply these two ratios together to get our final reduction of ~254.47:1.
  The motor's encoder counts 28 times per rotation. So in total you should see about 7125.16
  counts per rotation of the arm. We divide that by 360 to get the counts per degree. */

    In these variables you'll see a number in degrees, multiplied by the ticks per degree of the arm.
    This results in the number of encoder ticks the arm needs to move in order to achieve the ideal

            This is probably my favorite piece of code on this robot. It's a clever little software
            solution to a problem the robot has.
            This robot has an extending lift on the end of an arm shoulder. That arm shoulder should
            run to a specific angle, and stop there to collect from the field. And the angle that
            the shoulder should stop at changes based on how long the arm is (how far the lift is extended)
            so here, we add a compensation factor based on how far the lift is extended.
            That comp factor is multiplied by the number of mm the lift is extended, which
            results in the number of degrees we need to fudge our arm up by to keep the end of the arm
            the same distance from the field.
            Now we don't need this to happen when the arm is up and in scoring position. So if the arm
            is above 45°, then we just set armLiftComp to 0. It's only if it's below 45° that we set it
            to a value.

            We want the left trigger to move the arm up, and right trigger to move the arm down.
            So we add the right trigger's variable to the inverse of the left trigger. If you pull
            both triggers an equal amount, they cancel and leave the arm at zero. But if one is larger
            than the other, it "wins out". This variable is then multiplied by our FUDGE_FACTOR.

            This is a.... weird, way to set the position of a "closed loop" device. The lift is run
            with encoders. So it knows exactly where it is, and there's a limit to how far in and
            out it should run. Normally with mechanisms like this we just tell it to run to an exact
            position. This works a lot like our arm. Where we click a button and it goes to a position, then stops.
            But the drivers wanted more "open loop" controls. So we want the lift to keep extending for
            as long as we hold the bumpers, and when we let go of the bumper, stop where it is at.
            This allows the driver to manually set the position, and not have to have a bunch of different
            options for how far out it goes. But it also lets us enforce the end stops for the slide
            in software. So that the motor can't run past it's endstops and stall.
            We have our liftPosition variable, which we increment or decrement for every cycle (every
            time our main robot code runs) that we're holding the button. Now since every cycle can take
            a different amount of time to complete, and we want the lift to move at a constant speed,
            we measure how long each cycle takes with the cycletime variable. Then multiply the
            speed we want the lift to run at (in mm/sec) by the cycletime variable. There's no way
            that our lift can move 2800mm in one cycle, but since each cycle is only a fraction of a second,
            we are only incrementing it a small amount each cycle.
